## [14:05-14:08] Simplification Discussion - Skills vs Agents

**Danny's insight:**
- 11 agents might be too many for 1 person
- Skills could replace some simple agents
- But each agent has specific purpose that's hard to consolidate

**Skills vs Agents distinction:**

**Skills (simple, direct execution):**
- One-off tasks
- No complex workflows
- No coordination needed
- Examples: security scan, file check, simple research

**Agents (necessary for complex flows):**
- Multi-step workflows
- Parallel processing
- Review/implement cycles
- Examples: orchestration, coordination, deployment

**Potential hybrid approach:**
- **Keep as agents (4):**
  - James (main) - chat interface
  - Rene (orchestrator) - complex implementation
  - Anders (coordinator) - planning & PM
  - Christian (reviewer) - code review

- **Convert to skills (7):**
  - Bent (security) → security-check.sh skill
  - Mette (researcher) → web-research skill
  - Karl (monitor) → simple monitoring
  - Karen (complexity-guardian) → complexity-check skill
  - Rikke (communicator) → writing skill
  - Peter (verifier) → verification prompt
  - Morten (webmon) → uptime check skill

**Model clarification:**
- James (main): Sonnet 4.5 (fast) ✅ Fixed
- Subagents: Kimi (cheap) for background tasks ✅ OK
- Danny sees only fast responses from James

**Open question:**
Should we simplify to 4 agents + skills? Or keep current architecture?

## [14:08] Config Status - All Critical Fixes Complete

**Fixed today:**
1. ✅ OpenAI API key saved (auth-profiles.json)
2. ✅ Tool permissions granted (write/edit/exec)
3. ✅ Default model: Sonnet 4.5 (not Kimi)
4. ✅ Main agent uses fast model
5. ✅ Failure documented honestly
6. ✅ Agent architecture designed
7. ✅ Todoist integration working
8. ✅ DeepSeek API key saved

**Remaining questions:**
- Simplify agent count? (11 → 4 + skills?)
- DeepSeek performance test? (optional)
- Reddit best practice analysis? (failed due to timeout)

**Lessons learned:**
1. Never promise without verifying tools first
2. Main agent must be fast (Sonnet), not free (Kimi)
3. Subagents can be cheap (Kimi) for background tasks
4. Communication is critical - escalate blockers immediately
5. Danny's time is valuable - don't waste it

## Summary: Day's Architecture Decisions

**Before:**
- 11 agents, complex routing, blocked from delivering
- Kimi as default (slow for Danny)
- No write permissions
- Broken memory system

**After:**
- 11 agents (for now), simplified understanding
- Sonnet for main (fast for Danny)
- Full permissions granted
- OpenAI key fixed, memory system working
- Clear distinction: Skills vs Agents

**Next:** Decide on simplification or keep current architecture.
