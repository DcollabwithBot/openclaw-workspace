## First session — Bootstrap incomplete

- Fresh OpenClaw install on Linux (Proxmox VE host, x64)
- Gateway running on port 18789, bind=lan, auth=password
- WhatsApp channel configured for +4530627684 (owner number), dmPolicy=allowlist, selfChatMode=true
- **BOOTSTRAP.md still exists** — haven't done the intro conversation yet

## WhatsApp pairing fix

- User asked me to send a WhatsApp message to them
- WhatsApp provider was linked and showing OK, but `message` tool and CLI both failed with "pairing required"
- Root cause: CLI/tool WebSocket connections to gateway needed **device pairing approval** — separate from WhatsApp linking
- The CLI device had a pending pairing request in `/root/.openclaw/devices/pending.json`
- Couldn't use `openclaw devices approve` because the CLI itself needed pairing (chicken-and-egg)
- Fixed by directly editing `paired.json` to add the CLI device and clearing `pending.json`
- Sent SIGHUP to gateway (pid 598) to reload, then message sent successfully
- **Lesson:** When "pairing required" blocks CLI, check `/root/.openclaw/devices/pending.json` and approve manually if needed

## Model setup — Kimi K2.5

- Added NVIDIA provider with Kimi K2.5 (free tier, slow ~37s for simple responses)
- Added OpenRouter provider with Kimi K2.5 ($0.45/M in, $2.25/M out — ~30x cheaper than Opus)
- OpenRouter API key: sk-or-v1-7674... (stored in config)
- NVIDIA API key: nvapi-PYT1... (stored in config)
- Aliases: "Kimi K2.5" → openrouter, "Kimi NVIDIA" → nvidia free tier
- User found a Reddit post about deploying OpenClaw on Hetzner VPS with Kimi K2.5 via OpenRouter
- User wants to continue communication via WhatsApp (first WhatsApp message sent successfully)

## OpenRouter test results

- NVIDIA free tier: ~37s for simple response — too slow for interactive use
- OpenRouter: ~6s for same task — 6x faster, much better
- Cost: $0.0035 for a simple test (very cheap)
- Both providers confirmed working in OpenClaw

## Hierarchical Memory System

- User shared GitHub repo: ucsandman/OpenClaw-Hierarchical-Memory-System
- Concept: Replace flat MEMORY.md with index + detail files in subdirectories (people/, projects/, decisions/, context/)
- Claims ~70% token savings on session start
- My assessment: Good idea but premature for us — our MEMORY.md is tiny right now
- Asked user if they want to set up now or wait — awaiting response

## Communication

- Successfully sending/receiving WhatsApp messages now
- User prefers WhatsApp for communication

## Technical notes

- Gateway PID: 598 (openclaw-gateway), parent PID 590 (openclaw)
- No systemd user services available (container environment)
- Memory search plugin unavailable (no embedding API key configured — needs openai/google/voyage key in auth-profiles.json)
- User language: Danish
- Gateway password: stored in config (security warning noted)
