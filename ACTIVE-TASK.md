## Decisions Made
- Using this ACTIVE-TASK.md for dogfooding (meta!)
- Will test both name-based and role-based agent IDs

2. Create archive directory
3. Move 7 deprecated agent configs
4. Update indices and matrices
5. Run smoke tests
6. Git commit + push

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] ACTIVE-TASK.md exists and is used
- [ ] 7 agents archived
- [ ] AGENTS.md shows 4 agents
- [ ] Spawn matrix updated
- [ ] Smoke tests pass
- [ ] Git committed
- [ ] Memory updated

## Notes & Scratchpad
- Subagent spawned by James to execute runbook
- Testing both `agentId=rene` and `agentId=orchestrator`
- Will document any deviations from runbook
